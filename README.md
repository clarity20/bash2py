# bash2py
Bash-to-python transpiler    https://www.swag.uwaterloo.ca/bash2py/index.html<br>
Current version: 3.6

Bash2py is a tool designed to automate the translation from Bash to Python.

Coding has attempted to ensure that the source code for Bash 4.3.30 remains intact within this distribution. All changes to this source code (by intent) are to be compiled if and only if the BASH2PY macro is defined. This allows ready discovery of how the original source code has been changed.

The three main files changed are:
1.  Added:  fix_string.c<br>
    This attempts to mimic the bash command line transforms performed on the input prior to execution.

2.  Added:  translate.c<br>
    This attempts to translate high level bash commands. It is derived from print_cmd.c

3.  Changed: expr.c<br>
    This parses arithmetic expressions.  While the original code did this to compute an arithmetic result, the modified code does this to reformat bash arithmetic expressions into (it is hoped) appropriate equivalent Python expressions.

Documentation, attempting to describe those Bash constructs likely to be translated correctly by this tool, can be found at:

http://www.swag.uwaterloo.ca/bash2py/Bash2pyManual.html

This document is a heavily modified version of the Bash reference manual, permitting easy comprehension of all the features of Bash and which of these Bash2Py is likely to be able to handle.

Items highlighted in green have a good chance of translating correctly, those in orange may translate correctly some of the time, and those in red are not expected to be translated anywhere near correctly. Text in purple provides additional commentary.

Considerable work on this tool remains to be done.  It is stressed that it is distributed as is, without any warranty or assurance as to its functionality whatsoever.

### Contact:

Ian Davis at textserver.com@gmail.com to report concerns, or to request work be undertaken to further improve this product. 

WARNING: It is highly recommended that you backup any file/directory you wish to translate, before running bash2py on that file/directory. This is essentially prototype software, and mileage will vary.

### Instructions for installation:

- Download the latest version of this software from swag.uwaterloo.ca/bash2py

- `cd` into the project

- To setup, run this command:

```console
./install
```

### Usage

Run bash2py in any of the following ways:

1. Using the front end interface to invoke bash2pyengine

```console
./bash2py [-h] -f <SCRIPT>
./bash2py [-h] -d <DIRECTORY>
./bash2py [-h] <SCRIPT|DIRECTORY>
```

2. Invoking this engine directly

```console
./bash/bash2pyengine [--html] <SCRIPT>
```

If the -h/--html option is specified, a comparative before and after translation html file is generated rather than a python file. This is useful for observing the details of the translation process.

`<SCRIPT>` is replaced by the name of the script you want to translate, and `<DIRECTORY>` is the name of the directory you want to recursively translate.

Bash2py will put the translated Python file in the same directory as the corresponding Bash file, with the same name, but with a .py extension. HTML files will be assigned a .html extension.

Note: Bash2py is not perfect. You will have to review and edit the translated file by hand, to fix any errors that bash2py made in translation.
